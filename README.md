# Raspberry-QNX
Raspberry Pi -QNX  ( BCM2835 )
QNX Neutrino 6.5.0 sp1 BSP for Raspberry Pi b+ (bcm2835)

what is working 
1.Kernel Up & fully functioning 
2.Serial Debug 
3.Graphics
4.Some Extent SPI Touch screen ( Unfortunatly Photon is no longer supported in ARM architecture )

Features Yet to be added 
1.SPI 
2.I2C 
3.SD Card 
4.USB 
5.Network

code was derived from on at91sam9xx source , so I left the original code for SPI /I2C/USB/Input as it is ,
 hoping that it will be helpfull for the developers ..

I am working on QT Graphics support ..
